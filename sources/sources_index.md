## 📘 1. Alien Interview (2008, Lawrence R. Spencer)

**Description:**  
Originally published in 2008, *Alien Interview* presents alleged telepathic transcripts between  
Army nurse **Matilda O'Donnell MacElroy** and an extraterrestrial being named **Airl**, recovered after  
the 1947 Roswell crash. Airl describes Earth as a spiritual containment system where IS-BEs  
(Immortal Spiritual Beings) are trapped in a reincarnation cycle maintained by artificial control grids.

  in Farsight’s RV projects and other independent studies.
