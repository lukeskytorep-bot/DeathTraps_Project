# Technical Structure of the “Death Trap” System – Farsight Institute Data Extraction

**Source:** Farsight Mysteries Vault – *Death Traps Project*  
**Type:** Remote Viewing Empirical Summary (Yeme Jeaneé, Kahmia Dunson, Trudy Benjamin, Courtney Brown)  
**Focus:** Technical and operational characteristics of post-death control mechanisms.

---

## 1. General System Description

According to Farsight’s collected remote viewing data, the **Death Trap System** is a *technologically mediated mechanism* that operates at the energetic and consciousness level around Earth.  
Its purpose: **capture, memory erasure, and forced reincarnation of human souls (consciousness units).**

The process occurs automatically after biological death and is maintained by non-human operators or autonomous systems.

## 2. Core Operating Cycle

| Phase | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **1. Detachment** | Upon physical death, the consciousness (soul, IS-BE) detaches from the biological body. The being remains self-aware for a short time, often confused or emotionally charged. |
| **2. Attraction Phase** | Artificial energetic fields create **“pathways of light”**, **doorways**, or **corridors** that emit strong aesthetic and emotional attraction — warmth, love, beauty, comfort. |
| **3. Lure and Capture** | The being instinctively moves toward the light corridor. Once inside, it encounters a **controlled environment** that manipulates perception and emotion, drawing it deeper. |
| **4. Energetic Discharge Event** | Within the corridor, a violent **electromagnetic or electroshock-like event** occurs — accompanied by roaring, thunder, and flashes of light. The viewer describes it as “a lightning storm.” |
| **5. Memory Erasure** | The electrical discharge causes **amnesia and identity loss**. Consciousness is fragmented; previous life memories are wiped or overwritten with false implants. |
| **6. Conditioning Phase** | After the shock, the being enters a phase of **psychological programming**. Artificial imagery or entities appear — soothing figures, “guides,” or false heavenly scenes — to stabilize compliance. |
| **7. Reassignment / Reincarnation** | Once memory suppression is complete, the being is **redirected into a new body** on Earth, restarting the cycle with no recollection of prior existence. |

This seven-stage loop constitutes the **reincarnation control grid**.

## 3. Mechanistic Components (as described in RV data)

### 3.1 Energetic Infrastructure
- **Artificial Fields:** Circular, electromagnetic containment zones surrounding Earth’s upper atmosphere (the “soul net”).  
- **Light Corridors:** Projected energetic tunnels designed to mimic spiritual ascension experiences.  
- **Electroshock Emitters:** Concentrated bursts of energy used to reset the consciousness matrix (likened to “spiritual electroconvulsive therapy”).  
- **Vibrational Filters:** Layers that separate conscious frequency bands, preventing coherent memory continuity.

### 3.2 Control Interfaces
- **Entities / Operators:**  
  - Dark, shape-shifting beings resembling owls, masks, or humanoid shadows.  
  - Function as “technicians” maintaining the system.  
  - Some exhibit telepathic hostility; others appear neutral, acting as administrators.  
- **Automated Mechanisms:**  
  - Some elements appear autonomous — self-sustaining AI-like systems left behind by a defunct civilization (paralleling “Old Empire automation” described in *Alien Interview*).  
  - The system continues functioning without direct oversight.

### 3.3 Energy Signatures
- **Light Spectrum:** Bright white or gold, initially warm; after entry, shifts to red–orange or black hues (described as lava-like glow).  
- **Sound Spectrum:** Roaring, ringing, metallic thunder, high-frequency buzzing — indicative of electromagnetic activity.  
- **Sensory Manipulation:** Induces calm, then terror; sensory inversion maintains confusion and compliance.

---

## 4. Control Logic and Behavioral Engineering

### 4.1 Emotional Resonance Manipulation
- The system exploits **emotional frequency matching**: beings are guided by resonance toward environments that feel familiar or safe.  
- “Positive” imagery masks the trap; once the being relaxes, energy fields trigger capture.  
- Anger or resistance strengthens the electromagnetic bond — **the more emotional charge, the tighter the trap.**

### 4.2 Cognitive Suppression
- After electroshock, the mind is **fragmented** into memory clusters; only emotional residues survive.  
- Consciousness is reduced to reactive patterns — fear, confusion, obedience — making reinsertion seamless.  
- False memory programs may include symbolic narratives (religious scenes, guides, tunnels, judgment halls).

### 4.3 Reincarnation Vectoring
- Once stabilized, the being is pulled into a **reincarnation vector** — an energetic channel linking to embryonic human bodies.  
- Entry appears involuntary; the pull is magnetic and automatic.  
- The process erases any recollection of the intermediate stages.

## 5. Environmental & Spatial Description (RV Correlations)

| Viewer | Observed Environment | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| **Yeme Jeaneé** | Series of mirrored doors and light corridors; eventual transformation into fiery, electrical landscape. | Indicates layered simulation: aesthetic → punitive → erasure. |
| **Kahmia Dunson** | “River of souls” flowing toward an energetic hub; described as a teleporter leading to dark realm with tortured consciousness. | Suggests centralized processing facility. |
| **Trudy Benjamin** | Describes subject’s consciousness looping memories; trapped in repeating replay cycles (post-traumatic recursion). | Indicates cognitive containment layer. |

Common spatial motifs: circular chambers, vortex tunnels, mirrored or crystalline walls, red/orange electrical arcs, background vibration resembling plasma discharge.

## 6. Nature of the Operators (Non-Human Presence)

- **Three Primary Classes (from Yeme’s and Kahmia’s data):**
  1. **Controller Entities** – malevolent, intelligent, appear as shadows or animals (owl-like). Responsible for inducing fear and energy surges.  
  2. **Neutral Technicians** – less emotional, possibly mechanical or AI-driven. Maintain systems but without clear intent.  
  3. **False Benevolent Figures** – maternal or divine archetypes designed to pacify and attract the soul into compliance (“angelic” projection).

- These beings are **aware of observation** during RV sessions; several viewers report hostility or blocking attempts when probing too deep.

## 7. Cognitive Effects on the Captured Being

| Effect | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Emotional Amplification** | Anger, despair, or guilt amplified pre-capture to generate energy. |
| **Shock and Dissociation** | Sudden electromagnetic trauma producing memory disconnection. |
| **PTSD-like Looping** | Consciousness replays traumatic memories in closed loop (described as “hell” or “purgatory”). |
| **Loss of Self** | Complete detachment from identity; emergence of blank persona ready for reinsertion. |

These patterns correspond to **neurological reset analogues** seen in electroconvulsive therapy or high-intensity EM field exposure — but applied to nonphysical consciousness.

## 8. System Maintenance and Longevity

- Described as **ancient and self-sustaining**, still operating thousands of years after original installation.  
- The controllers that originally built it (“Orion or Old Empire factions”) no longer rule openly but maintain **clandestine automated operations**.  
- The mechanism is **multi-layered**, with redundancy — disabling one sector does not stop the overall function.  
- May involve nodes on **the Moon or Mars**, or nonphysical satellites forming part of the field network.

---

## 9. Counter-Mechanisms and Resistance (observed in control sessions)

When the subject avoids the light or refuses external guidance:
- No electrical discharge occurs.  
- Memory remains intact.  
- Transition is smooth; consciousness expands into broader awareness.  
- Contact occurs with “origin group” or “non-physical guides” outside the Earth grid.  

This suggests that the system’s capture depends on **voluntary resonance alignment** — it requires the being’s consent (even if unconscious).

## 10. Summary of Operational Dynamics

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Light Corridor** | Sensory lure; entrance to capture field. |
| **Electroshock Zone** | Energetic reset; memory wipe and identity fragmentation. |
| **Programming Zone** | Insertion of false imagery, emotional pacification. |
| **Reincarnation Vector** | Channel pulling blank consciousness into new body. |
| **Controllers / Technicians** | Maintain energy flow and emotional feedback cycles. |
| **Planetary Grid** | Containment field ensuring that all souls remain within Earth’s energetic envelope. |

## 11. Key Technical Indicators (cross-viewer agreement)

- **Electricity / Lightning / Roaring:** Signature of active capture.  
- **Circular Structures / Corridors:** Spatial design of the trap mechanism.  
- **False Light Transition:** Primary sensory deception.  
- **Looping Consciousness:** Evidence of data overwriting and fragmentation.  
- **Presence of Dark Non-Human Operators:** System maintenance and defense.  
- **Magnetic Reincarnation Pull:** Automatic re-entry into Earth bodies.

### Summary Statement

> “If you are drawn to the light, you will get stuck, zapped, and memory-wiped. Under normal conditions there are no such pathways — death is simple freedom.”  
> — Courtney Brown, Farsight Director

The data collectively describe a **hybrid electro-energetic and cognitive control grid**, functioning as a **closed reincarnation system** enveloping Earth.  
Its operation depends simultaneously on **technology, emotional manipulation, and resonance consent** — a fusion of machinery and psychology.
